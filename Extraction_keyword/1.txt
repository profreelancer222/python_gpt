Unfortunately project titled "PDF Reader with Bulge Size and Speed Effect Plus TTS Sync to Bulge Speed.", this specific project is already being executed by another freelancer for a few dozen dollars. If, by any chance, you have already completed a similar project, I might be interested in purchasing it from you at a provisional price. This would be primarily for the purpose of comparing the quality of work.

However, there's another task that is still open and might align with your expertise. It involves AI-based marking of words and sentences across different lines. I am curious to know your interest in this challenge and, importantly, your proposed fee for undertaking it. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could share your approach to executing this task.
